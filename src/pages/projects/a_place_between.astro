        <i>A Place Between </i> is a short immersive theater piece co-created with 
        <OutsideLink link="https://zoemargolis.net/"> Zoe Margolis </OutsideLink> and 
        workshopped at NYU in October of 2023 in the Performance Garage of 370 Jay St. We

        worked with students from Graduate Musical Theater Writing during the brainstorming process, 
        and invited students from across departments to be part of the workshop, development,
