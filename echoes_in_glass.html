            <h2> Echoes in Glass </h2>

            <p> <i>Echoes in Glass </i> is an interactive cycle of original stories, poems, and songs, 
                centered on themes of connection, love, 
                and loss. Bringing together the realms of theater, oral storytelling, and interactive 
                experience, it invites audiences to enter a world of monsters, myths, and memories, 
                where stories are distilled into jars and spirits are invoked to help bring them to life. 
                As spirits, the audience is given the agency to choose how they will move through the world 
                — as watchers, keepers, or active participants, they follow two leader-spirits and a human 
                archivist as they delve together through a collection of story-jars in an attempt to untangle 
                and understand the past. </p>

            <h3> Read an Excerpt </h3>

            <h3> Production History </h3>
            <p> In addition to writing/composing the piece, I directed and designed a production of <i> Echoes in Glass </i>
                with the Princeton Program in Theater in December 2019 (pictured below), as my thesis work 
                 for Princeton's theater certificate program. </p>
