      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

        <h2> About </h2>
        <p> I am a thinker and tinkerer, a dreamer and do-er, learning what it means to be a creative individual 
            in collaboration with the world. I am fascinated by a myriad of topics, including world mythology, 
            evolutionary biology, and the inner workings of computers. I like making things, telling stories, 
            and looking for the patterns and connections that tie us all together. </p>
